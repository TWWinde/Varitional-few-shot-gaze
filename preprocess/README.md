# Preprocessing script for Faze

This is a repository for the code used to generate input data for the ICCV 2019 oral paper: *Few-Shot Adaptive Gaze Estimation*. The main code repository can be found at https://github.com/NVlabs/few_shot_gaze

The procedure outlined here is a prerequisite for running the training or evaluation code in the [main repository](https://github.com/NVlabs/few_shot_gaze).

Please cite our paper when using this pipeline in your research works:

    @inproceedings{Park2019ICCV,
      author    = {Seonwook Park and Shalini De Mello and Pavlo Molchanov and Umar Iqbal and Otmar Hilliges and Jan Kautz},
      title     = {Few-Shot Adaptive Gaze Estimation},
      year      = {2019},
      booktitle = {International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)},
      location  = {Seoul, Korea}
    }

 ## Setup
 
 1. Download all required prerequisite files by running `bash grab_prerequisites.bash`.
 2. Edit the paths defined at the bottom of the main script to point to the actual data paths. More information on where to acquire the original datasets are provided below.
 2. Run the main script using `python3 create_hdf_files_for_faze.py`
 
 ## Datasets
 
 ### MPIIFaceGaze
 
 The [MPIIFaceGaze dataset](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/research/gaze-based-human-computer-interaction/its-written-all-over-your-face-full-face-appearance-based-gaze-estimation/) is a subset of the original [MPIIGaze dataset](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/research/gaze-based-human-computer-interaction/appearance-based-gaze-estimation-in-the-wild/) which includes a privacy-aware release of face images. This subset was used for evaluations of full-face gaze estimation methods.
 
 When using this dataset, the following works should be cited:
